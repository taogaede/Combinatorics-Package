# Combinatorics Project 

 Work In Progress: Contains bugs.  Apologies for the tiny readme, I will be updating it soon.

## What This is
Compartmentalization and annotation framework for studying constructions of, and functions on, finite sets of numbers/strings, as elements, in sequences, and in matrices.

At the moment, this project mainly exists to assist my own learning of mathematics and software development.  However, if you're interested in using the framework, and want to help build the operation library, I would be thrilled to hear from you!

## Who This is For
Anyone interested in studying finite sets and their constructions using java, and who feels they'd benefit from having a framework to compartmentalize and annotate their code.

(I would be interested in making this work in other languages (particularly C++ and Python), but I don't know other languages at this time, so that would be a later project)
